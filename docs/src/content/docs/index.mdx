## Why LeapSQL?

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Pure SQL" icon="document">
    Write standard SQL without learning a new DSL. Dependencies are automatically detected from your queries.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Column-Level Lineage" icon="random">
    Track data flow at the column level. Know exactly where each field comes from and how it's transformed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Starlark Macros" icon="setting">
    Create reusable SQL patterns with Starlark, a Python-like language that's safe and deterministic.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fast Execution" icon="rocket">
    Built in Go for speed. Run transformations on DuckDB for lightning-fast local development.

## Quick Example

```sql
/*---
name: customers
materialized: table
---*/

SELECT
    c.id,
    c.name,
    c.email,
    COUNT(o.id) as order_count,
    SUM(o.amount) as total_spent
FROM raw_customers c
LEFT JOIN raw_orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.id, c.name, c.email
```

LeapSQL automatically:
- Detects that this model depends on `raw_customers` and `raw_orders`
- Tracks that `order_count` comes from `orders.id` and `total_spent` from `orders.amount`
- Builds and runs models in the correct order
