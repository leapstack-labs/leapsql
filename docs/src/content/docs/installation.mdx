description: How to install LeapSQL on your system
---

LeapSQL is distributed as a single binary with no external dependencies. Choose the installation method that works best for your environment.

## From Source (Recommended)

If you have Go 1.21+ installed:

```bash
go install github.com/yacobolo/leapsql/cmd/leapsql@latest
```

This installs the `leapsql` binary to your `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

## Pre-built Binaries

Download the latest release for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/yacobolo/leapsql/releases).

### macOS

```bash
# Intel Mac
curl -L https://github.com/yacobolo/leapsql/releases/latest/download/leapsql-darwin-amd64 -o leapsql
chmod +x leapsql
sudo mv leapsql /usr/local/bin/

# Apple Silicon
curl -L https://github.com/yacobolo/leapsql/releases/latest/download/leapsql-darwin-arm64 -o leapsql
chmod +x leapsql
sudo mv leapsql /usr/local/bin/
```

### Linux

```bash
# x86_64
curl -L https://github.com/yacobolo/leapsql/releases/latest/download/leapsql-linux-amd64 -o leapsql
chmod +x leapsql
sudo mv leapsql /usr/local/bin/

# ARM64
curl -L https://github.com/yacobolo/leapsql/releases/latest/download/leapsql-linux-arm64 -o leapsql
chmod +x leapsql
sudo mv leapsql /usr/local/bin/
```

### Windows

```powershell
# Download the Windows binary
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/yacobolo/leapsql/releases/latest/download/leapsql-windows-amd64.exe" -OutFile "leapsql.exe"

# Add to PATH or move to a directory in your PATH
```

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify that LeapSQL is working:

```bash
leapsql version
```

You should see output like:

```
LeapSQL version 0.1.0
```

## Database Dependencies

### DuckDB

LeapSQL uses DuckDB as its default database engine. DuckDB is embedded directly into LeapSQL - no separate installation is required.

The DuckDB database file is created automatically in your project directory when you first run LeapSQL.

## Project Setup

Once installed, you can create a new project:

```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir my-project
cd my-project

# Create the standard directory structure
mkdir -p models/staging models/marts seeds macros

# Initialize by running your first command
leapsql list
```

This creates the `.leapsql/` directory containing:
- `state.db` - SQLite database tracking run history and lineage
- `data.db` - DuckDB database containing your actual data

## Configuration

LeapSQL uses sensible defaults and requires minimal configuration. Optional configuration can be provided via environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `LEAPSQL_MODELS_DIR` | Directory containing SQL models | `models/` |
| `LEAPSQL_SEEDS_DIR` | Directory containing seed CSV files | `seeds/` |
| `LEAPSQL_MACROS_DIR` | Directory containing Starlark macros | `macros/` |
| `LEAPSQL_TARGET` | Target environment name | `dev` |

## Troubleshooting

### Command not found

If you get "command not found" after installation:

1. Ensure the binary is in your PATH
2. For Go installs, ensure `$GOPATH/bin` is in your PATH:
   ```bash
   export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
   ```

### Permission denied

If you get permission errors:

```bash
chmod +x /path/to/leapsql
```

### DuckDB errors

DuckDB is embedded in LeapSQL, but if you encounter issues:

1. Ensure you have write permissions in the project directory
2. Check that `.leapsql/data.db` isn't locked by another process
3. Try deleting `.leapsql/data.db` to start fresh
