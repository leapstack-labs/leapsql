title: Quickstart
description: Get up and running with LeapSQL in 5 minutes
---

This guide will help you create your first LeapSQL project and run your first transformation.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or later (for building from source)
- DuckDB (automatically managed by LeapSQL)

## Installation

```bash
# Install from source
go install github.com/yacobolo/leapsql/cmd/leapsql@latest

# Verify installation
leapsql version
```

## Create Your First Project

### 1. Set Up the Directory Structure

```bash
mkdir my-project
cd my-project

# Create the required directories
mkdir -p models/staging models/marts seeds macros
```

### 2. Add Seed Data

Create a seed file with sample data:

```csv title="seeds/raw_customers.csv"
id,name,email,created_at
1,Alice,alice@example.com,2024-01-15
2,Bob,bob@example.com,2024-01-16
3,Charlie,charlie@example.com,2024-01-17
```

```csv title="seeds/raw_orders.csv"
id,customer_id,amount,order_date
1,1,100.00,2024-01-20
2,1,50.00,2024-01-21
3,2,75.00,2024-01-22
4,3,200.00,2024-01-23
```

### 3. Load Seed Data

```bash
leapsql seed
```

This creates tables from your CSV files in the DuckDB database.

### 4. Create Your First Model

Create a staging model that cleans up the raw data:

```sql title="models/staging/stg_customers.sql"
/*---
name: stg_customers
materialized: view
---*/

SELECT
    id as customer_id,
    TRIM(name) as customer_name,
    LOWER(email) as email,
    created_at::DATE as signup_date
FROM raw_customers
```

### 5. Create a Mart Model

Create a model that aggregates customer data:

```sql title="models/marts/customer_summary.sql"
/*---
name: customer_summary
materialized: table
---*/

SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name,
    c.email,
    c.signup_date,
    COUNT(o.id) as total_orders,
    COALESCE(SUM(o.amount), 0) as total_spent,
    MAX(o.order_date) as last_order_date
FROM stg_customers c
LEFT JOIN raw_orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.customer_name, c.email, c.signup_date
```

### 6. Run Your Models

```bash
# Run all models
leapsql run

# Or run a specific model
leapsql run --select customer_summary
```

### 7. Explore the Results

```bash
# List all models and their status
leapsql list

# View the dependency graph
leapsql dag
```

## What Just Happened?

1. **Seed loading**: LeapSQL loaded your CSV files into DuckDB tables
2. **Dependency detection**: LeapSQL analyzed your SQL and determined that:
   - `stg_customers` depends on `raw_customers`
   - `customer_summary` depends on `stg_customers` and `raw_orders`
3. **Ordered execution**: Models were run in the correct order based on dependencies
4. **Lineage tracking**: LeapSQL recorded how columns flow through your transformations

## Add a Macro

Create a reusable macro for common transformations:

```python title="macros/utils.star"
def cents_to_dollars(column):
    """Convert cents to dollars with 2 decimal places"""
    return "ROUND({} / 100.0, 2)".format(column)

def safe_divide(numerator, denominator):
    """Division that returns NULL instead of error on zero"""
    return "CASE WHEN {} = 0 THEN NULL ELSE {} / {} END".format(
        denominator, numerator, denominator
    )
```

Use it in a model:

```sql title="models/marts/order_metrics.sql"
/*---
name: order_metrics
materialized: table
---*/

SELECT
    customer_id,
    COUNT(*) as order_count,
    {{ utils.cents_to_dollars('SUM(amount_cents)') }} as total_dollars,
    {{ utils.safe_divide('SUM(amount)', 'COUNT(*)') }} as avg_order_value
FROM raw_orders
GROUP BY customer_id
```
