# SQL Lint Rules

LeapSQL includes 32 SQL lint rules organized into 5 categories.

## Aliasing {#aliasing}

Rules about alias usage and naming conventions.

| ID | Name | Description | Severity | Dialects |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| `AL03` | aliasing.expression | Expression columns should have explicit aliases. | `info` | all |
| `AL04` | aliasing.unique_table | Table aliases should be unique within a query. | `error` | all |
| `AL05` | aliasing.unused | Table alias is defined but not referenced. | `warning` | all |
| `AL06` | aliasing.length | Alias length should be between min and max characters. | `info` | all |
| `AL07` | aliasing.forbid | Forbidden alias patterns (e.g., single letters, t1/t2). | `warning` | all |
| `AL08` | aliasing.unique_column | Column aliases should be unique within SELECT clause. | `warning` | all |
| `AL09` | aliasing.self_alias | Table aliased to its own name is redundant. | `hint` | all |

## Ambiguous {#ambiguous}

Rules about ambiguous SQL constructs that may cause confusion or errors.

| ID | Name | Description | Severity | Dialects |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| `AM01` | ambiguous.distinct | Using DISTINCT with GROUP BY is redundant. | `warning` | all |
| `AM02` | ambiguous.union | UNION without ALL performs implicit DISTINCT which may be unintended. | `info` | all |
| `AM03` | ambiguous.order_by | ORDER BY column may be ambiguous in set operation. | `warning` | all |
| `AM04` | ambiguous.column_count | Mismatched column counts in set operation. | `error` | all |
| `AM05` | ambiguous.join | Comma-separated tables create an implicit cross join. | `info` | all |
| `AM06` | ambiguous.column_refs | Unqualified column reference may be ambiguous with multiple tables. | `warning` | all |
| `AM08` | ambiguous.join_condition | Join condition should reference both tables being joined. | `warning` | all |
| `AM09` | ambiguous.order_by_limit | ORDER BY/LIMIT with set operation may have unexpected scope. | `warning` | all |

## Convention {#convention}

Rules about SQL coding conventions and style consistency.

| ID | Name | Description | Severity | Dialects |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| `CV01` | convention.not_equal | Prefer != over <> for not equal operator (NOT IMPLEMENTED: AST normalizes both operators). | `hint` | all |
| `CV02` | convention.coalesce | Prefer COALESCE over IFNULL/NVL for better portability. | `hint` | all |
| `CV04` | convention.count_rows | Prefer COUNT(*) over COUNT(1) for counting rows. | `hint` | all |
| `CV05` | convention.is_null | Use IS NULL instead of = NULL for NULL comparisons. | `warning` | all |
| `CV08` | convention.left_join | Prefer LEFT JOIN over RIGHT JOIN for consistency. | `hint` | all |
| `CV09` | convention.blocked_words | Block dangerous SQL keywords like DELETE, DROP, TRUNCATE. | `warning` | all |

## References {#references}

Rules about column and table references in queries.

| ID | Name | Description | Severity | Dialects |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| `RF02` | references.qualification | Qualify column references in queries with multiple tables. | `warning` | all |
| `RF03` | references.consistent | Column qualification style should be consistent. | `info` | all |

## Structure {#structure}

Rules about SQL query structure and organization.

| ID | Name | Description | Severity | Dialects |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| `ST01` | structure.else_null | ELSE NULL is redundant in CASE expressions. | `hint` | all |
| `ST02` | structure.simple_case | Searched CASE can be simplified to simple CASE expression. | `hint` | all |
| `ST03` | structure.unused_cte | CTE is defined but never referenced. | `warning` | all |
| `ST04` | structure.nested_case | Nested CASE expressions reduce readability. | `info` | all |
| `ST06` | structure.column_order | Wildcards should appear last in SELECT clause. | `hint` | all |
| `ST07` | structure.using | Prefer USING clause for simple equality joins on same-named columns. | `hint` | all |
| `ST08` | structure.distinct | Consider GROUP BY instead of DISTINCT when selecting columns for aggregation. | `info` | all |
| `ST09` | structure.join_condition_order | Join condition should reference left table first (e.g., a.id = b.id, not b.id = a.id). | `hint` | all |
| `ST10` | structure.constant_expression | Unnecessary constant expressions like WHERE 1=1 or WHERE true. | `info` | all |
