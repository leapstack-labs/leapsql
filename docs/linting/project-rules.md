# Project Lint Rules

LeapSQL includes 13 project lint rules organized into 3 categories.

## Modeling {#modeling}

Rules about model structure and DAG organization.

| ID | Name | Description | Severity | Config |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| `PM01` | root-models | Models with no sources (broken DAG lineage) | `warning` |  |
| `PM02` | source-fanout | Source referenced by multiple non-staging models | `warning` |  |
| `PM03` | staging-depends-staging | Staging model references another staging model | `warning` |  |
| `PM04` | model-fanout | Model has too many direct downstream consumers | `warning` | `threshold` |
| `PM05` | too-many-joins | Model references too many upstream models | `warning` | `threshold` |
| `PM06` | downstream-on-source | Marts or intermediate model depends directly on source (not staging) | `warning` |  |
| `PM07` | rejoining-upstream | Unnecessary intermediate model in a fan-in pattern (A→B, A→C, B→C where B has no other consumers) | `warning` |  |

## Lineage {#lineage}

Rules about data lineage and column dependencies.

| ID | Name | Description | Severity | Config |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| `PL01` | passthrough-bloat | Model has too many passthrough columns | `warning` | `threshold` |
| `PL02` | orphaned-columns | Columns not used by any downstream model | `info` |  |
| `PL04` | implicit-cross-join | JOINs with no visible join keys in column lineage | `warning` |  |
| `PL05` | schema-drift | SELECT * from source with changed schema since last run | `warning` |  |

## Structure {#structure}

Rules about project structure and naming conventions.

| ID | Name | Description | Severity | Config |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| `PS01` | model-naming | Model naming convention mismatch | `warning` |  |
| `PS02` | model-directory | Model directory mismatch | `warning` |  |
